Purpose
---
The	 purpose	 of	 this	 assignment	 is	 to	 allow	 you	 to	 experiment	 with	 multiple	
uninformed	search	algorithms,	which	will	include	a	representation	of	the	world,	
an	algorithm	for	search,	and	the	observation	of	some	metrics	associated	with	the	
search	algorithms you	are	using.

Description
---
The	 following	 undirected	 weighted	 graph	 represents	 the	 connectivity	 between	
various	 cities	 in	 Romania.	 Each	 edge	 means	 that	 there	 is	 a	 bidirectional	 path	
between	the	connecting	nodes.	The	number	on	the	edges	represents	the	cost	to	
travel	from	one	city	to	another.
